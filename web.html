      For this project we were given creative autonomy over the subject.
      I chose to continue the conversation surrounding the issue of black manhood.
       On this site, there are three pages which question the ways in which we view black masculinity
     in our society, and push for alternative images and definitions to be attached to
     our perceptions of black manhood. This challeging of new ideas regarding the black male identity I feel
     is extremely important due to the fact that the current ideals we live by as black men, cause us to both
     harm ourselves emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually, as well as those who come in contact with
     specifically black women, and queer people of color.

    For this project we were instructed to recreate our first web page which was a questionaire. 
    This was our introduction to css, and we were supposed to utilize css to style our questionaire.
    I chose to experiment with the placement of texts using the margin-left css tag. I also chose to 
    style my link, changing the color to make it apparent to the user that these select words were links. 
    To further accomplish this we were introduced to the multiple tags that could accompany our links in 
    css such as hover. Lastly I chose to also experiement with colored backgrounds for my text.

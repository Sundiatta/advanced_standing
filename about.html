      <div id="text">
      Sundiatta Small is a 21 year old New Media student with a
       minor in media studies at SUNY Purchase, born and raised in
        Brooklyn, NY, and currently lives in Queens, NY. When he isn’t geeking out
        about Black Panther, Sundiatta works the current Vice President of The Organization
        of African People In The Americas (OAPIA) club at SUNY Purchase.
        As an eboard member of this club, Sundiatta works to facilitate spaces where
        students can come to learn about and respect and accept all forms of black culture,
        stemming from the many ethnicities of Africa, to African Americans. Sundiatta is also
        a proud black nerd, or “blerd.” He loves graphic novels, his current favorites being
        Paper Girls and East of West. Aside from comics he has a very deep love for video games,
        specifically Super Smash Bro’s WiiU and Super Smash Bro’s Melee.

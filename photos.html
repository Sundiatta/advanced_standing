            For my final project in In Intro To Digital Photography, my professor
            allowed us to have creative freedom. So I decided to speak on the habit
            we have as adults to look down upon children, and the essence of the child
             which lives in each of us. For when we are children we are our most purest,
           honest selves. For this project I asked each model questions focusing on their
            happiest memories as children, and the ways in which we control the
            beliefs of children, now allowing them to question and be curious.
             After these questions were answered I then instructed my models to finger
             paint on a canvas I provided with any color paint they wished. While these
              things were going on I encouraged them to be as silly or as calm as they wanted,
              increasing their level of comfort in the space.
              I then asked them to pose and show off their painted hands
              in order for me to capture these moments of pure happiness.

      For this series I was instructed to go out and find people who would be willing to be a model for us in order to conduct portrait photography shoots. Professor Kim, encouraged to create environments in which the model would feel the most comfortable. He suggested that we do simple things such as play music and converse with our models, in order to make them feel as comfortable as possible. For this shoot, I was specifically interested in getting Ashley to show the aspects of herself that she prefers not to show to the everyday person. She was a young woman who walked with command of the room, one could instantly know that she was an extremely strong woman. While I felt that this aspect of her personality was important, I felt is also important to show that she was a very sweet, and silly young woman, who when given the space, would be willing to express that side of herself.

      This photo shoot was also conducted for the portrait photography assignment. Monique, was a very interesting subject to shoot. She was more comfortable taking the shoot in her apartment which was perfect for me because I was allowed further access into her world, and as a result her personality. I began asking her questions about her work, and sooner or later she began to express her interest in black folk artists from the twenties. Though she was calm and reserved, she still expressed control over the space, and whoever was in it. This duality was shown through her body language as well as her verbal expression. Which is why I was able to capture this duality.

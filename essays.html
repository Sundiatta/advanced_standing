        As a young African American man growing up in a time where the foundations of society as we
        currently know it, specifically many of the social political issues that have plagued this
        country and the world at large, are being recognized and aggressively combated, I have begun to
        recognize how these issues have affected my upbringing. One of these foundations being,
        the black male identity, specifically black masculinity. The images, and ideals our society has,
        surrounding the definition of black masculinity has been both created and controlled predominantly
        by white cis men. One of the main areas in which these ideals are being constantly reinforced, is
        through our media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social media, entertainment media as well as news outlets, all perpetuate
        the negative beliefs we have attached to black masculinity. As a result, the emotional and mental
        well being of black men, both young and old has been incredibly damaged, so much so that this pain
        stemming from the learned belief that our identity as black men is to be non emotional, strictly
        violent and always dominant, has both robbed us of our humanity as men, and caused us to inflict
        damage on to those around us, specifically black women. Though these toxic behaviors have become so
        deeply rooted in black men as a whole, I believe that, because the generations living in this current
        time period are being exposed to more media at a higher rate due to the internet, and social
         media intake,the web to be a tool that can be utilized to effectively combat these ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
         For my senior project I propose to expand upon my final web project entitled “Black Man Is” making it
         into an online media outlet or magazine promoting ideals of black masculinity that challenge
         our current understanding of what being a black man means, and looks like.
         In order to successfully produce this project, I would like to
         take the following courses: <br>
      </p>
         <ul>
          <li>Scripting for the web</li>
          <li>Creating User Interfaces</li>
          <li>Creating Databases for Web Applications</li>
          <li>Networking and Security</li>
          <li>Mobile Computing</li>
          <li>Information Aesthetics</li>
          <li>Social Software</li>
          <li>Experimental Web Practice</li>
          <li>Social Design</li>
          <li>Drawing moving and seeing with code</li>
          <li>New Directions in Virtual Space</li>
          <li>Introduction to Physical Computing</li>
          <li>Mobile Media</li>
        </ul>
        I have also currently earned a job with the psga as webmaster for the psga website,
        so in order to continue to strengthen my abilities and experience as a web developer
        and computer programmer, I will continue building professional sites for mass consumption.
        This I feel is very important, because I will building this site for the everyday user.
         I also am currently applying for web development internships with companies such as
         Google and Artsy, all with the intention of learning the best way to effectively
         ensure user interaction with my site.

        Out of all of the courses that I have taken up to this point, three of them have either encouraged me,
        or given me an opportunity to question the concepts of societal norms, and how they affect me,
        and allow me to showcase this habit of the questioning and challenging of societal normalities
        in my work. These three courses were “Intro To Digital Photography,” “Intro To The Web” and
        “Video Art 1.” During my first semester at Purchase college, I studied digital photography
        with professor Yong Kim. I had previously had an interest in photography, specifically
        portrait photography but my understanding of the beauty and power behind portrait photography had
        been lacking, until one day during class professor Kim put on a documentary about the photographer
        Annie Leibovitz. Being introduced to her work and methods inspired me to challenge myself
        for our final project, which lead me to create the series “A Child’s Anthem.” I was interested
        in making this piece because of my time at purchase. I was interested
        in the spirit of the child who is
        always curious, always asking
        questions. Never taking anything at face value due to their understanding of their lack of knowledge.
        Most importantly the freedom children naturally exhibit before the ideals of their environment begin
        to shape who they are, peaked my interest. So I decided to evoke the essence of each of my models
        child selves through a series of questions asking them about their childhood and
        their happiest memories as children. After questioning them, I then asked them to
        finger paint on a canvas I purchased. I instructed them to choose the colors they wanted,
        and allowed them to freely paint on the canvas. Afterwards, I asked them to pose in anyway
        they felt in order to keep this feeling of freedom they had, while only having to show the
        paint on their hands.

        Soon after, I took both Video Art 1 and Intro To The Web. While taking Video Art 1, taught by
        professor Sara Magenheimer, I was exposed to video artists Arthur Jafa and Kahlil Joseph.
        Both their cinematography styles, as well as content served as partial inspiration for my
        final project, entitled “The White Room,” a piece dealing specifically with the inner turmoil
        of black men suffering from toxic masculine ideals. In this film I create an inner dialogue
        between the main character, and the suppressed aspects of his personality all of which live
        within his subconscious which is represented by a white room. Each of the suppressed personality
        traits serve as guides to his acceptance of himself. As previously stated I was deeply inspired by
        the works of Arthur Jafa and Kahlil Joseph, however the greater inspiration behind this film came from my experiences outside of the classroom. As a young black male, I constantly feel the effects of toxic black masculinity, and have been consistently working to unteach myself these ideals. The most common among these issues I have encountered in my own life is the definition of masculinity, meaning, all black men have to move, talk and think a specific way. If you do anything feminine you are automatically homosexual, which is also viewed very violently as a negative thing.

        This idea of heterosexual men having to fit in a very tightly woven box of traits that strip us of our emotions, our empathy, joy is, as a result, stripping us of our humanity. The stripping of black male identity is what I decided to combat through my work due to my own experiences, being afraid of my own identity, and taking on a personality that was not my own, in order to survive. This lead me to creating my final project for Intro To Web, taught by
        Michael Bell-Smith, entitled, “Black Man Is.” This piece was a combination of three pages each dedicated to challenging the ways in which we attach certain ideas to the black male body. One page, entitled “Hear The Image” deals with our habit of attaching certain music to certain images of black men. In order to do this, I supply a negatively coded image of a black male, and attach a song, such as Symphony No. 40 by Mozart to challenge our perception of the placement of certain things in specific orders, and encourage the audience to ask why they think this sound does not belong with this image. Another page entitled “The Manhood Gallery” challenges our ideas of manhood, through visual representation. In this gallery, I place images of soft black masculinity, with the intent of forcing the audience to recognize an opposing visual of black manhood. Lastly I include a written poem entitled, “Am I A Man Yet.” This poem illustrates the internal, emotional damage men are taught to force onto themselves, and the ways in which this damage negatively affects those around them. These three pieces along with my experiences in my personal life, have inspired me to continue to combat this issue, using the internet as a platform to do so.

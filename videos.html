      <div id="title"><center>THE WHITE ROOM</center></div>
      <div id="text">
        For this piece, I was instructed to create 5 videos each having to be 30 seconds  to 1 minute in length. we were also asked to find or write a letter or a piece of text and record someone reading the text, and include that audio in the piece. In regards to content, our piece had to deal with the idea of truths versus lies. Some of the questions we were asked to think about when creating our piece were, “What does truth look like? (i.e. what are the aesthetic qualities that make us assume something is true?)," “How can we play with assumptions about fact and fiction to get a greater personal truth?” I chose to focus on the issues surround black male identity, and the masks black men craft and utilize to hide who they are from the world as well as themselves.

      <div id="text2">
        For this assignment we were given creative freedom. The minstrel show is a collection of found footage showcasing images of blackface, and minstrel cartoons, which I then used a speech by James Baldwin to bring attention to the fact that the creation of the character, of the “nigger” , was created and utilized by white people in order to degrade a group of people. Baldwin then asks the white population, why is it necessary for you to have this character?

      <div id="text3">
        The Manifesto project was an assignment which was given to us in which we were tasked with creating a set of rules for ourselves to follow while making a film. For example we were not allowed to utilize anyone we had previously had in one of our films for this project.
        I was not allowed to use a setting that I had previously used, and there was to be no music added on to this piece, and the footage we used in the beginning we were to use to end the video with.
        For this piece I collaborated with new media student Nicholas Umpierrez.
